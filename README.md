This example demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in PHP when using foreach loops with pass-by-reference and objects.  The unexpected behavior arises because modifications within the loop directly affect the object's properties, rather than the object's reference itself.  This can lead to unexpected results when working with objects in foreach loops using pass by reference. The solution demonstrates the correct way of handling such situations.
